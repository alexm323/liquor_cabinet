1. What tech stack will you use for your final project? We recommend that you use

React and Node for this project, however if you are extremely interested in

becoming a Python developer you are welcome to use Python/Flask for this

project.

- I will be using a combination of React Native and Firebase for this application which will be a mobile app.
  
  

2. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are

you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?

- The focus of the project will be to focus on the front end of the mobile design while utilizing the full power of the API. 
3. Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
- This will be a mobile app that I hope to deploy on Android by the end of it. 
4. What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
- The overall goal is to learn about the type of work that goes into creating mobile apps with react native as well as the additional work involved in actually deploying this kind of application in an app store. 
5. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of

your users?
- This application can appeal to any users that are looking to elevate their drinking which I think is pretty safe to say will be a roaring market after quarantine is over. It can appeal to anyone over the legal drinking age that is looking to enjoy drinks they might have the ingredients to.

6. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?

- The Cocktail DB API has all of the data that I require including data that allows me to filter and search recipes using available ingredients. 

7. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project 

a. What does your database schema look like?
- This project will require that I learn firebase to use with the react native framework since they pair well together. The database schema will require just simple user tables that contain basic information as well as information on the liquor that a user has available. There are some other features I could add that allows a user to favorite certain drink recipes that they have enjoyed and possibly even create custom drinks that can be shared among other users but features are still tentative. 

b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? This is especially

important if you are creating your own API, web scraping produces

notoriously messy data.
- The API I am looking at has decent data but I will need to incorporate some additional filtering on the backend to get the required data and that might be difficult based on matching certain ingredients exactly. 

c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
- Standard user information but honestly this app could also work without user information but I am looking to collect standard user info. 
d. What functionality will your app include?
- Filter drinks based on ingredients on hand and recommending random beverages that fit these requirements. 
e. What will the user flow look like?
- The user will be able to look at drink recipes without signing up or logging in but being able to login enables a user to input user info (including drink ingredients they have available) and this will unlock the functionality that allows a user to get custom beverage recommendations. 
f. What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your

stretch goals?
- The specific filtering makes it really specific to a user and is meant to be a companion for people looking to try new drinks that they have the ingredients for. Additional goals would involve releasing it on real app stores.
